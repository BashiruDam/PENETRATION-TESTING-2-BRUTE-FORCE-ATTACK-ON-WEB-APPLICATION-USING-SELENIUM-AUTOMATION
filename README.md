# PENETRATION-TESTING-2-BRUTE-FORCE-ATTACK-ON-WEB-APPLICATION-USING-SELENIUM-AUTOMATION
This project explores how automated tools like Selenium and Python can be used to ethically test
the login security of web applications. A simulated penetration test was conducted on
“https://demo.testfire.net”, a purposely vulnerable site intended for security research. Using
scripts developed in Python, we simulated brute-force login attempts with both invalid and valid
credentials. The results showed that although the application rejects invalid credentials correctly,
it lacks essential defense mechanisms such as CAPTCHA, account lockout, and rate-limiting.
The findings suggest that applications without these controls remain highly vulnerable to
automation-based attacks. This report provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the tools used,
the methodology followed, and ethical implications drawn from the results.
